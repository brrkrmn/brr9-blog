Hey there!

I’m Berra, a self-taught developer from Turkey.

As I approach the end of my first year of programming, I have embarked on a new journey into open source, marking my initial experience in this field.

This is the first entry of a series of posts where I’ll be sharing my journey as an Outreachy intern working with Unstructured Studio. If you wish to learn more about Outreachy and this community, follow along!

### Outreachy

Outreachy is an internship program fostering diversity in the tech industry by offering opportunities to individuals who are underrepresented in the field, allowing them to contribute to open-source projects. I first learned about Outreachy in April 2023 while listening to one of [Anjana Vakil's talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo0qiGPSV-s).

As someone studying a non-tech-related field, this program caught my attention for its inclusiveness, not demanding any prior tech experience. I decided to apply for the December cohort, and luckily, I managed to get in on my first try.

### Unstructured Studio

As the deadline for the initial application approached, I started checking out different projects and communities from previous years. I specifically looked for projects whose requirements aligned with my skill set. That’s when I encountered Unstructured Studio’s Zubhub.

Along with the fact that the project is written with React, its overarching goal, centered around activity-based learning, resonated with my academic background. This compatibility gave me confidence in making a meaningful contribution to the project. I was aware that project selection plays a crucial role in getting selected, thus, I made this decision with careful consideration. Now that I am an official Outreachy intern in Unstructured Studio, it is safe to say that I made the right choice.

It’s been over 2 months since my first contribution to this project, and I’ve already learned a great deal. I look forward to making more contributions to the project and collaborating with this amazing community!
